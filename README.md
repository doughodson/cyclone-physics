Cyclone Physics Engine
======================

This is a fork of the codebase for Ian Millington's codebase for his excellent book "Game Physics Engine Development: How
to Build a Robust Commercial-Grade Physics Engine for your Game - 2nd Edition"

It is being updated to compile with current Visual Studio 2017.

It should not be difficult to compile with gcc or clang.

Along the way, the code will be updated to modern C++ usage with more explicit typecasts.
